        <p>
          It is Barbara's twenty-first birthday and she is having a small garden
          party in the beautifully tended garden at her mother Virginia's house.
          Two young men, brothers, Charles and William, have been invited to the
          party. Barbara has been dating the stable and reliable William for six
          months to the day now. She had previously dated Charles in a whirlwind
          romance that ended as abruptly as it began.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship between William and Barbara is... stable. One might
          say dull. He is calm, assured, considerate, and almost entirely
          predictable. There is warmth, but more than that, there is security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship between Charles and Barbara had been anything but
          sedate. It was dramatic and passionate, an affair of vibrant emotions
          and hormones. The fights were as heated as the romance, and they
          eventually led to the break-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is not known to Barbara is that both young men intend to propose
          to her tonight. William is planning a quiet proposal at the end of the
          evening. Charles, on the other hand, has decided that the passion he
          still feels for Barbara is not something he wishes to contain and
          plans a large and showy proposal on the spot. This will spur on
          William to act in making his own proposal, not as he would have
          wished, but in self-defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evening, Barbara will have to decide which of the two brothers
          she wishes to wed. William offers her someone she can trust, and a
          predictable and stable life. Charles still ignites her passion, but
          everything about him is a risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          With her daughter caught at a crucial turning point in her young life,
          Virginia hopes to provide support and guidance. Virginia's own
          marriage while beginning in passion, turned into a loveless thing
          after a few years. In their day, divorce was not so common and there
          was Barbara to think about, so they remained together until his
          passing five years ago. Whether Virginia will try to turn her daughter
          towards one of the two men or to allow her daughter to make her own
          decision without influence is up to her.

      <h2>1968</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Barbara's garden party birthday is going to be difficult this year. 
          Tensions are running high, and her marriage to Charles has been going
          through a rocky time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barbara and Charles Gardener have been married for nearly two years
          now.  There have been many ups and downs: periods of fiery passion,
          followed by periods of heated arguments, distance and tearful making
          up.  Right now they are in one of the hard times.  They still love
          each other deeply, but they have been fighting, mostly about trivial
          things: where to go to dinner, whether to have friends over on a given
          night, how often to see Barbara's mother Virginia, or Charles's
          brother William.  Sometimes the fights have been more serious: money
          and Charles's spendthrift habits, whether or not they are ready for a
          child. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When they are fighting, Charles frequently disappears: usually for the
          evening, occasionally for the night, once for almost a week.  Barbara
          fears that he is cheating on her, but he denies it, and she has found
          no evidence.  With Charles gone, Barbara has been spending more time
          with her brother-in-law, William.  William has been offering her
          comfort and reassurances, while worrying about the degradation of the
          marriage.  At the same time, some of the old spark has kindled between
          William and Barbara. Seeing the problems in her relationship with
          Charles, Barbara has begun to wonder if she would have been better off
          with the reliable William.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Virginia has been watching Charles and Barbara's
          deteriorating relationship with great concern.  While her marriage had
          its problems, she believes in the sanctity of marriage, and wants her
          daughter to try to resolve her own marital issues. At the same time,
          she is very worried that Charles might be off with another woman.  If
          things must come to a head, she wants it to happen before children are
          involved.

      <h2>1968</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Barbara and William Gardener have been married for almost two years
          now.  William graduated from law school this spring and has just
          started a good entry level job at a large firm.  They bought a house,
          and are starting to plan a family.  On the surface, they are the
          perfect young couple, but underneath, something is missing.  Despite
          William's gentle and caring ways, Barbara is lonely.  She has been
          spending more of her time with friends, and less time with William. 
          He's been so busy with work, but that isn't all. He never moved her in
          the way Charles did.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she has been looking for something more, Charles has been right
          there.  Charles has not found anyone else, and he's still head over
          heels for Barbara.  He tries very hard to support his brother, but
          when Barbara comes to him, he can't help but think that it should have
          been him instead.  The passion between them is still palpable to
          everyone except William. Even after the shocking proposal two years
          ago, William can't really believe his little brother would ever hurt
          him like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Virginia has been watching all of this with great concern. 
          She sees the same patterns in Barbara and William's marriage that
          happened in her marriage to Frederick, and she knows how lonely that
          can be.  At the same time, she is very worried about the interaction
          between Barbara and Charles.  The marriage vows are sacred; a little
          loneliness does not change that.  She has been looking for ways to
          coax William and Barbara back together.  William loves her so much. 
          If only she could convince him to show it a little more.  He's so
          quiet, so responsible.  Barbara needs to truly know how important she
          is to William.  Virginia has been trying to encourage William to be a
          little more like his brother, without losing his stability.

          Barbara's marriage to Charles is well and truly on the rocks this
          time.  The question isn't simply whether the marriage will survive
          long term.  The big question is: will their marriage even survive
          tonight's party?
        </p>
        <p>
          Barbara has recently found out that after the blow up over Karen,
          Charles actually did start cheating on her.  She had been planning on
          going through with her birthday party tonight, but at this point,
          she's not sure she can handle the situation.  It's time to confront
          Charles about what he has done to her, especially at this important
          time.  She has big news and needs to know whether or not Charles will
          truly be there for her. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Barbara's affair with William ended a month ago, at William's
          prodding.  Barbara has decided it was a mistake and moved on, blaming
          her indiscretion on Charles' own bad behavior. William, however, has
          been carrying guilt for the affair ever since. He feels that this has
          been going on too long and he can't bear the secret of his betrayal of
          his brother, no matter what Charles himself has done.  Tonight he
          plans to confess and beg Charles' forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Charles got a new job teaching theater at the local
          college. After he left the high school, he and Karen broke up over
          Charles' guilt about cheating (and the slow dimming of their own
          passion).  Charles is ready to beg Barbara's forgiveness and try to
          start over, if she'll have him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Virginia is watching this all from the sidelines with tears in her
          eyes.  She doesn't know for sure about all the cheating that has been
          happening, but she is hoping desperately that Barbara and Charles can
          resolve their issues. Will Barbara and Charles' marriage survive all
          the betrayals?

          plans to confess and beg Charles' forgiveness. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, after the end of the affair, Barbara has been wondering
          more and more whether she made the right decision.  She's pregnant,
          and, not only is she not entirely sure whose child it is, she's not
          sure which she would prefer.  While she was in the affair with
          William, she could see the stability that she had given up. Now that
          it's over, she's left without a buffer against the tumult of her
          marriage.  She hasn't yet told anyone she's pregnant.  If she tells
          Charles that she's pregnant with his child, he'll almost certainly
          forgive her any trespass.  On the other hand, if she can convince
          William it's his, maybe she could leave Charles and marry William - if
          William would even have her after the past few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Charles got a new job teaching theater at the local
          college. However, with Barbara so upset, Charles has become ever more
          volatile.  He doesn't understand what's going on with her, and he
          can't fix it, which just makes him angry and frustrated. All he wants
          is to resolve things, but sometimes he thinks it's not even worth it
          anymore.  He feels like he doesn't even know his own wife, and doesn't
          know what to do.

          Meanwhile, in her turmoil, she has often wondered whether she made the
          right choice.  Would she have been happier with the stable William? He
          has been there for her through all this, calm and reassuring.  He
          never tried to take advantage of her in her grief, despite how close
          they got, and she respects him for it.  She knows he still loves her.

        <p>
          Since the fight over Karen, nothing has gone well for them. Barbara
          hasn't really trusted him since, but she's never dug up any evidence
          that he did cheat on her. Charles has only grown more distant.  They
          barely talk except when they're fighting. Sometimes Barbara almost
          wishes she had found evidence of an affair. Then at least there would
          be someone to blame it on. As it is, everything is falling apart and
          neither seems to know why. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Barbara has been wondering more and more whether she should
          just leave Charles and try to start over. Recently, however, that
          option has gotten more complicated: Barbara is pregnant. She hasn't
          yet told anyone she's pregnant. If she tells Charles that she's
          pregnant with his child, he'll almost certainly do everything he can
          to make up with her. At this point, she's not sure she wants that.
          Maybe she could still leave Charles and patch things up with William.
          William has his own problems, but at least he's stable.

        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, William has thrown himself more and more into
          his work. The relationship between him and Barbara - never a terribly
          passionate one - has grown more and more distant and strained. William
          loves her in his own way, but the only way he knows to show it is by
          working hard for her, bringing home a good paycheck, and making sure
          that she has a stable life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile. Barbara was bored stiff. She craved attention and passion.
          She missed the passion that she had with Charles, and wondered whether
          she made the wrong decision in marrying William. Charles has gone off
          to start a new job teaching theater at the University, and his life
          finally seems to be coming together. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When Charles showed up again, she couldn't resist him. The affair only
          went on for a few months before she decided that she couldn't continue
          betraying her husband that way. Since then, however, Barbara has been
          even more lost and lonely in her marriage. Even worse, Barbara has
          recently found out that she is pregnant, and she is terrified that
          having a child with William will trap her in this boring life forever.
          To complicate matters further, she's not completely sure it's even

          leave.  She made her choice and he doesn't want to betray his brother
          again.  They have gotten a little too close once or twice, but each
          time, Barbara has stood her ground, and Charles has felt guilty and
          left them alone, sometimes for months.  It's hard for him to be around
          them. He can't stand to see Barbara so lost and lonely.

          shifted from Barbara's birthday to that of her five-year old daughter
          Stephanie.  After Charles and Barbara divorced, Barbara remarried
          William. While the relations between the brothers have been strained,
          Charles is very involved in Stephanie's life, and has tried hard to be
          a good father. Even through the divorce, fatherhood has brought some
          stability to his life, and he lives for his weekends with his
          daughter.  He has dated a few other women, but none seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barbara and William are doing well. William has a good job at a law
          firm, and, while their marriage lacks the passion that Barbara's
          relationship with Charles had, it also lacks the tumult. William works
          long hours, but since Stephanie was born, Barbara has been relatively
          content to focus on her young daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, however, a new issue has come up. Barbara's mother,
          Virginia, has had a stroke, and can no longer manage on her own. 
          Barbara and William need to decide whether to care for her themselves,
          or send her to a nursing home. They recently bought a new house, and
          the cost of a nursing home would be hard on them. However, Barbara is
          very busy chasing after Stephanie, and the extra work of caring for an
          ailing parent would be difficult. She has been considering going back
          to college to become a teacher once Stephanie is in school, and caring
          for Virginia would make that very difficult. At the same time, tuition
          might make the costs of a nursing home even more prohibitive.

          This year, as for the past four years, the garden party has been
          shifted from Barbara's birthday to that of her five-year old daughter
          Stephanie.  Since Barbara got pregnant, both Charles and Barbara
          recommitted to their marriage. While there have been many fights
          since, and many of the same problems are still present, the birth of
          their daughter Stephanie strengthened their marriage.  Even during the
          worst times, both of them have reason to stay and work things out. 
        </p>
        <p>
          William has never married, but has become a very successful lawyer. He
          is a doting uncle, giving Stephanie many gifts, and sometimes taking
          the entire family to the zoo or other events.  He doesn't have a lot
          of free time with his practice, but much of what he does, he spends on
          his niece.

          Recently, however, a new issue has come up.  Barbara's mother,

          a lot of money at the college. However, Barbara is very busy chasing
          after Stephanie, and the extra work of caring for an ailing parent
          would be difficult.  She has been considering studying to become a
          teacher once Stephanie is in school, and caring for Virginia would
          make that very difficult. At the same time, tuition might make the
          costs of a nursing home even more prohibitive.

          This year, as for the past four years, the garden party has been
          shifted from Barbara's birthday to that of her five-year old daughter
          Stephanie.  After William and Barbara divorced, Barbara has struggled
          as a single mother. William has contributed financially to Stephanie's
          upbringing, but rarely visits.  Since he made partner in the law firm,
          he hasn't had enough time to help out.  Besides, he still finds it
          hard to see Barbara like this, but he knows that he can't go back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles has remained connected, at least as connected as Charles ever
          was. He has drifted in and out of Barbara and Stephanie's lives.  They
          have been involved on and off, but he is such a destabilizing
          influence that Barbara never wanted him to be too present in
          Stephanie's life.  She always felt that letting Charles become a
          father-figure to Stephanie would be worse than no father. With his
          flair for the dramatic, he could break her heart almost by accident. 
          She's young and grows attached too easily.  How could she handle it if
          he suddenly disappeared? Still, they reconnect occasionally, and
          Stephanie is quite fond of him.

        <p>
          Recently, however, a new issue has come up. Barbara's mother,
          Virginia, has had a stroke, and can no longer manage on her own. 
          Barbara needs to decide whether to care for her in her home or send
          her to a nursing home. Without additional help, she probably can't
          afford the cost of a nursing home. However, Barbara is very busy
          chasing after Stephanie, and the extra work of caring for an ailing
          parent would be difficult. She has been considering going back to
          college to become a teacher once Stephanie is in school, and caring
          for Virginia might make that impossible. At the same time, tuition
          might make the costs of a nursing home even more prohibitive.

          arm's length. He still tries hard to connect with his brother, but
          William was never terribly good at reaching out.  Charles is still
          teaching at the local college, but no one, not even him, seems quite

        <p>
          Since Virginia went into the nursing home, the financial issues that
          Barbara and Charles faced have gone from bad to worse.  The medical
          bills leading up to Virginia's death were hard enough, and her funeral
          put another substantial drain on their finances. While Barbara started
          going to college, she dropped out after a year, unable to pay the
          tuition. They have been having a hard time just paying for rent and
          groceries. Charles' job at the college doesn't pay very well and their
          9-year old daughter, Stephanie, brings her own expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, things got even worse.  Frustrated by the issues at home,
          Charles took off for a few days. He spent most of that time playing
          cards and drinking, and he lost more money than they can afford.  If
          they don't get some extra help from somewhere, they will be risking
          eviction. Barbara has been alternating between yelling at Charles and
          crying. Neither of them know what to do or where to go from here. 
          Barbara has considered trying to find work, but she has no marketable
          skills and a young daughter to care for.  Meanwhile, Charles has been
          working up his courage to ask William for a loan.  After Barbara and
          William's affair several years ago, it's hard for Charles to think
          about turning to William for help, but right now he doesn't know what
          else to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, William isn't sure whether or not to volunteer help.  He's
          doing well on his own, but he tries to be responsible and save.  He's
          helped Barbara out with small things a few times before, mostly gifts
          for Stephanie. He doesn't want to reward Charles' bad behavior. At the
          same time, he still feels guilty about his affair with Barbara and
          doesn't want to see Barbara suffer.  But if he helps now, what about
          the next time? How can he draw a line to keep this from happening
          again?

          Since Virginia moved in with Barbara and Charles, the financial issues
          that they faced have gone from bad to worse.  They were having a hard
          time paying rent, but then the medical bills leading up to Virginia's
          death put them further into debt, and her funeral strained their
          already tenuous situation to the breaking point. Barbara is still
          considering applying to college, but she doesn't have the money for
          tuition. They have been having a hard time just paying for rent and
          groceries. Charles' job at the college doesn't pay very well, and
          their 9-year old daughter Stephanie brings her own expenses.

          working up his courage to ask William for a loan.  William still
          hasn't forgiven Charles for all the heartache he caused Barbara, and
          Charles doesn't want to humiliate himself in front of his brother
          again.

          Meanwhile, William isn't sure whether to volunteer to help.  He's

          Charles gets forgiven and helped every time he screws up, how will he
          ever learn? It will be just like the affair Charles had all over
          again.  Besides, if William helps now, what about the next time? How
          can he draw a line to keep this from happening again?

          While William helped to pay for Virginia's care, since Virginia's
          death, he has not reached out to Barbara.  He has always been
          responsible about paying child support and given Stephanie nice gifts,
          even if he never spent very much time with her. A few months ago, his
          firm folded.  He has still been helping out when he can, but right now
          he is struggling to make mortgage payments while looking for a new
          job. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Barbara's part-time secretarial work does not pay the bills, and with
          William out of work, she isn't getting much from him. Taking care of a
          9-year old has a lot of small expenses, and just keeping up with the
          rent is hard enough.  She's not sure how she can make ends meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles, on the other hand, had a break recently.  He got a few stage
          parts, and from there has gotten several advertising roles, and even a
          minor role in a television show being shot locally.  For the first
          time, he actually has a little extra money, although most of it has
          gone to gambling and a string of short-term girlfriends.  He's always
          been willing to help out with small things, but Barbara doesn't like
          turning to him. He's still infatuated with her, but she doesn't want
          him around Stephanie too much. Will Barbara turn to him, and, if so,
          will he be able and willing to help with something this big?

          This year, the garden party is celebrating Stephanie's 17th birthday,
          but all is not well in the Gardener family. Stephanie has been caught
          driving drunk and her court date is next week. While this is the first

        <p>
          William has strong connections, and with a little pushing, he could
          get the case put in front of a lenient judge, and either get her off
          entirely, or get her off with a slap on the wrist. He has certainly
          done it for Charles in the past. At the same time, after all the help
          he has given the couple, can they really turn to him again? Even if
          they can, is it a good idea to get Stephanie off the hook for this?
        </p>
        <p>
          If she does get convicted, she will lose her license until she's 18.
          She has an after school job working at a restaurant that she needs the
          car to get to. Barbara has been very busy with her new teaching job,
          and could not drive her. If Stephanie gets convicted, she would
          probably have to quit her job. Barbara encouraged her to get a job in
          the first place to learn some responsibility. If she has to quit over

          This party marks Stephanie's 23rd birthday and she has brought her
          boyfriend, Zack Bloom. Zack and Stephanie know each other from high
          school, and Zack has had a troubled past.  He went to juvie several
          times for drug-related offenses and assault. While he hasn't been
          arrested since he turned 18, Barbara and Charles are not certain they
          trust his claims of being clean.  There were rumors that he was
          dealing serious drugs to his classmates, and even that he was part of
          a gang.  His tattoos and shaved head don't make him easy to trust.

          After the drunk driving incident, William's help allowed Stephanie to
          get off easy.  But the intervening few years have been hard.
           Stephanie wound up on drugs and was forced to go through
          court-mandated rehab. However, since William died of a sudden heart
          attack a few years back, Stephanie has pulled herself together. After
          his death, she finally realized that no one would be there to pull her
          out of the next fire and started taking care of herself. She got a job
          at the supermarket and moved out into a small apartment in town.
        </p>
        <p>
          She met Zack again at the supermarket and they began reminiscing about
          high school. Soon enough they were dating, and now, almost six months
          later, they have come to this party to announce their engagement.
          While Charles has his concerns, he is mostly just happy to see
          Stephanie moving on with her life, but Barbara is worried.  She really
          hoped that Stephanie would pull herself together and go to college,
          and now she's afraid that won't happen.  She's even more worried that
          Zack might still be dealing, and that this could set Stephanie up for
          a relapse.

          After having her driver's license revoked and doing several weeks of
          community service following her drunk driving incident, Stephanie
          started pulling her act together. When William died of a sudden heart
          attack a few years ago, Stephanie used a chunk of her inheritance to
          go to community college, and then went on to begin an accounting
          degree at a state university. She will be graduating this winter and
          has been doing well in her classes.

          afraid that Zack could pull Stephanie off the successful path she
          seems to have found. Barbara is particularly concerned that Zack might
          still be dealing, and that this could set Stephanie up for a relapse.

          Stephanie had a hard few years after the drunk driving
          incident.  Losing her driver's license and her job just sent her into
          a downward spiral. She wound up getting involved in drugs and going

          heart attack a few years back, Stephanie has pulled herself together.
          After his death, she took some of the money she inherited and went
          into therapy. She got a job at the supermarket and moved out into a

          to help out with Stephanie's recovery. He sees a lot of himself in her

          Stephanie and Zach Bloom are doing well. They have two children,
          Jessica, age 10 and Michael, age 7. Stephanie has recently gone back
          to work as an accountant. With her help, Zach bought the garage where
          he works, and the business has been fairly successful. He has even
          hired a couple new people to help out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things have not been going as well for Charles and Barbara. A few
          years back, Barbara was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This year
          she had to quit her job, and caring for her has been taking more and
          more of Charles' time. Money has been very tight since Barbara stopped
          working, and Barbara and Charles are fighting about money yet again.
          Things are made even worse by the fact that Charles can't leave:
          Barbara can't make do without him, even for a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stephanie and Zach have been discussing whether or not to help out,
          and if so, how to do so. After watching her grandmother languish alone
          in a nursing home, Stephanie feels like she should provide more
          personal care to her mother, maybe even buying a larger house and
          inviting her parents to move in. At the same time, with two children,
          Stephanie's work, and Zach's business, none of them have much time to
          help. They could pay for someone to come in and help out Barbara a few
          days a week,  but Stephanie feels like she should do more. Will that
          even help enough to make a difference? Maybe Barbara really needs to
          be in assisted living somewhere. Can Stephanie and Zach afford that?
          Do they want to?

        </p>
        <p>
          Since Charles and Barbara refused to accept Zach twelve years ago,
          Stephanie's relationship with her parents has been very strained.
           Last year, Barbara reached out to her daughter.  With her failing
          health, she wanted to mend fences.  Since then, Stephanie has been
          talking more with her parents, and she and Barbara have begun to
          rebuild their relationship.

          Stephanie and Zach have been discussing whether or not to help out
          Charles and Barbara, and if so, how to do so. Stephanie is still very
          angry at her parents for their rejection of Zach, but Zach worries
          that if she doesn't help, and her parents continue to suffer,
          Stephanie will regret it.  If Zach and Stephanie do decide to help
          out, they have the money to make a difference. They could pay for
          someone to come in and help out Barbara a few days a week, but that
          won't mend the wounds the way personal care would. After watching her
          grandmother languish alone in a nursing home, Stephanie feels like she
          should be the one to care for her mother.  Just providing money won't
          heal their relationship. At the same time, with two children,
          Stephanie's work, and Zach's business, time is limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will Stephanie and Zach help at all? If so, will Stephanie devote time
          to caring for her mother, or will she simply pay for help and be done
          with it? Can Barbara and Stephanie mend their broken relationship this
          late in the game?

          this late in the game?
