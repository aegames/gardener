**Year: 1970**

Barbara's marriage to William is well and truly on the rocks. The question isn't simply whether the marriage will survive long-term. The big question is: will their marriage even survive tonight's party?

Over the past two years, William has thrown himself more and more into his work. The relationship between him and Barbara - never a terribly passionate one - has grown more and more distant and strained. William loves her in his own way, but the only way he knows to show it is by working hard for her, bringing home a good paycheck, and making sure that she has a stable life.

Meanwhile. Barbara was bored stiff. She craved attention and passion. She missed the passion that she had with Charles, and wondered whether she made the wrong decision in marrying William. Charles has gone off to start a new job teaching theater at the University, and his life finally seems to be coming together.

When Charles showed up again, she couldn't resist him. The affair only went on for a few months before she decided that she couldn't continue betraying her husband that way. Since then, however, Barbara has been even more lost and lonely in her marriage. Even worse, Barbara has recently found out that she is pregnant, and she is terrified that having a child with William will trap her in this boring life forever. To complicate matters further, she's not completely sure it's even William's child.

Virginia is very worried about the state of her daughter's marriage. She is hoping desperately that Barbara and William can resolve their issues, but she also worries about Barbara feeling trapped. She hopes that a child might help the marriage, but is afraid that they will have a child first, and divorce after. Will Barbara and William's marriage survive?
