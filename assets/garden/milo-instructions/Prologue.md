**Prologue: Milo**

The funeral is over.  Jessica's eulogy was beautiful.  Now it's time to get down to the business of Dad's weird conditions in his last will and testament.  You've gathered the family in a back room at the funeral home, and placed the first of two banker's boxes on the table.  Inside is the first half of Dad's magnum opus.

_The scene will begin when you start talking.  Take a moment, get into character, and tell the family about how Dad spent the last years of his life, and what you all have to do now.  Feel free to refer back to your character sheet, or ask the GM any questions you have._
