**Intermission: Milo**

You go to open the second banker's box. When you pick it up to put it on the table, you notice for the first time that it feels considerably lighter than the first.  It seems that Dad didn't finish writing all the possible paths for this story.

Frustrated, you begin searching through the next scene.  There are actually only three versions of it.  You're going to have to give each reading group one of them, and while you'd like to do your best not to change the backstory too much, there's only so much you can do with what you have here.

_The scene will begin when you start talking.  Take a deep breath, and get ready to tell the family what you've just discovered._
