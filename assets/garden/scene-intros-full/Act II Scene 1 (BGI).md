**Year: 1979**

While William helped to pay for Virginia's care, since Virginia's death, he has not reached out to Barbara. He has always been responsible about paying child support and given Stephanie nice gifts, even if he never spent very much time with her. A few months ago, his firm folded. He has still been helping out when he can, but right now he is struggling to make mortgage payments while looking for a new job.

Barbara's part-time secretarial work does not pay the bills, and with William out of work, she isn't getting much from him. Taking care of a 9-year old has a lot of small expenses, and just keeping up with the rent is hard enough. She's not sure how she can make ends meet.

Charles, on the other hand, had a break recently. He got a few stage parts, and from there has gotten several advertising roles, and even a minor role in a television show being shot locally. For the first time, he actually has a little extra money, although most of it has gone to gambling and a string of short-term girlfriends. He's always been willing to help out with small things, but Barbara doesn't like turning to him. He's still infatuated with her, but she doesn't want him around Stephanie too much. Will Barbara turn to him, and, if so, will he be able and willing to help with something this big?
